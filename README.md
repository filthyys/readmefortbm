## Welcome to Cardinal!
Welcome to Cardinal, the best minecraft utility client, fulfilling all your utilities.
This client includes some amazing code, such as:
- Crystal Aura
- XRay
- "Rock Paper Scissors"-minigame

To prove we're competent developers, here's a math equation we solved: 

$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots$$

Clearly we know what we're doing. Now, give us your money.
